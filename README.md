ECOMMERCE SALES ANALYSIS REPORT
Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce sales data, offering key insights into sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and operational efficiency across various dimensions. The report is designed to help stakeholders understand sales trends, identify top-performing areas, and pinpoint areas for improvement.
Dashboard Sections and Key Metrics
The dashboard is structured into several key sections, each providing different perspectives on the sales data:
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

 * Sum of Shipping Cost: Total cost incurred for shipping all orders.
2. Filters
On the right side of the dashboard, filters allow users to interactively narrow down the data:
 * Category: Filters data by product categories (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).
 * Market: Filters data by geographical market (e.g., Africa, APAC, Canada).
3. Top 5 Country Sales
This section uses a donut chart to visualize the distribution of sales across the top 5 countries by sales volume. It provides a quick overview of the most significant markets in terms of revenue.
4. Top 3 State Sales
This bar chart (or similar visualization) displays sales performance for the top 3 states, likely within a selected country or overall, offering a regional breakdown of sales.
5. Sales by Category
A bar chart showing the total sales for each product category. This helps in understanding which product categories are generating the most revenue.
